Present the results of three methods for finding the kth smallest element in a given collection of integer numbers. The methods are the following:

The kmin algorithm you implemented for your third programming assignment (PA2).
Using a binary search tree as implemented for your second programming assignment (PA1), and the MIN and SUC operations to identify the kth smallest element in the tree.
Using the built-in quicksort function of C to sort the input integers and then identify the kth smallest element among them.
To compare the methods, create an input file with 1,000,000 random integer numbers, and use the three methods to find the kth smallest element for varying values of k. Report on the efficiency of each method. Possibly identify values of k for which one method outperforms another.

Present details of the three methods, analysis of their asymptotic complexity, and your results about their efficiency. Of particular interest are the values of k for which one method can outperform another. Explain and justify your results and observations.

Your presentation should be concise and use illustrations and/or animations to explain the concepts where applicable. Use of figures/diagrams will be particularly useful when explaining your results.

Your presentation should be aimed towards an audience that understands the material taught in our class. Your video presentation will be reviewed based on a rubricPreview the document.

The presentations will be undertaken in groups of three or two, the same groups as with your programming assignments. You have to create a screencast presentation no longer than 6 minutes. All three students have to present; try to divide the presentation time equitably. You have to upload your presentation on youtube and make it available only to people who have the link (public but not listed). Then you have to submit the youtube link (web address) on canvas by the deadline.

There are several free and for-pay tools of varied sophistication available for creating screencasts. One simple tool I have used in the past is screencast-o-matic, but I am sure you can find several other tools that will suit your needs.
