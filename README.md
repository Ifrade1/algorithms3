# Algorithms projects 3 & 4
From the presentation description: "Using the built-in quicksort function of C to sort the input integers and then identify the kth smallest element among them." 

Do not write your own sorting algorithm. C has its own built-in quicksort:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparator-function-of-qsort-in-c/

This can be used to sort arrays. then its just a simple matter of returning first element in the array.




Current Priorites: 
 
  -Please write a simple file testing the quicksort function. I don't think you need to write the function, it should be in the c standard library.(I added a quick sort program and text file in the quicksort.c branch; need to add reading text file implementation); 
  
  
 PA2.c works now. changed all the int variables to long to include integers within the signed 64-bit integer range
 
  -create a makefile (use the previous makefile and edit PA1 to PA1. DONE; makefile works; do not change!
  To compile makefile:
  make
./kmin
