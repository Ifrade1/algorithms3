# Algorithms projects 3 & 4

Current Priorites: 
 
  -Please write a simple file testing the quicksort function. I don't think you need to write function, it should be in the c standard library.(I added a quick sort program and text file in the quicksort.c branch); 
  -need to figure out how to compile and run with the text file
 -need to implement fidning the kth smallest integer from a text file
  -create a PA2.c file with a main function
 
  -create a makefile (use the previous makefile and edit PA1 to PA1.
