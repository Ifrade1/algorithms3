# Algorithms projects 3 & 4
From the presentation description: "Using the built-in quicksort function of C to sort the input integers and then identify the kth smallest element among them." 
Do not write your own sorting algorithm. C has its own built-in quicksort:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparator-function-of-qsort-in-c/
This can be used to sort arrays. then its just a simple matter of returning first element in the array.

Current Priorites: 
 
  -Please write a simple file testing the quicksort function. I don't think you need to write the function, it should be in the c standard library.(I added a quick sort program and text file in the quicksort.c branch); 
  
  
  -need to figure out how to compile and run with the text file
 -need to implement fidning the kth smallest integer from a text file
  -create a PA2.c file with a main function
 
  -create a makefile (use the previous makefile and edit PA1 to PA1.
