# Algorithms projects 3 & 4

Current Priorites: 
 *Please write a simple file testing the quicksort function. I don't think you need to write function, it should be in the c standard library.
 
 *create a PA2.c file with a main function
 
 *create a makefile (use the previous makefile and edit PA1 to PA1.
